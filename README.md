# Orbit-Simulator
This simulator is currently in production, though the overall goal is to create a simulator that accurately depicts satellite orbits around earth, with more goals to come.
Current Goals:

- Create a central sphere object [X]
- Create smaller objects orbiting central sphere [X]
- Use accurate distances/volumes/speeds [X]
- Allow rotation around X and Y axes. [X]
- setup cone regions on earth dependent on longitude and latitude. [X]
- change satellite spheres to cone arrows [X]
- apply earth texture [X]
- colour coded X, Y, Z axes [X]
- positive x, y, z axes attached to main satellite. [X]
- satellite detected when it enters the cone region. [X]
- Satellite points at given point upon entering the cone region[ ] (it works half of the time)
- Satellite point in opposite direction of given point upon entering the cone region (ex. zenith) [ ]
