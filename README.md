# Orbit-Simulator
This simulator is currently in production, though the overall goal is to create a simulator that accurately depicts satellite orbits around earth, with more goals to come.
Current Goals:

- Create a central sphere object
- Create smaller objects orbiting central sphere
- Enforce Keppler's laws on the gravitiing objects
