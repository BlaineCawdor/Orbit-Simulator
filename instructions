1. install the Java3D API. This site gives step by step instructions. https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/cs324e/handouts/setUpJava3dEclipse.htm

2. Compile and run the code available in the file EllipseTest.java 
It began as a test to try out different ways to get the satellites to orbit in ellipses, 
and it eventually just became the next version of the simulation.
So this is the up to date, fully commented version of the simulation.
