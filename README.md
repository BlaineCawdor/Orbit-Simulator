# Orbit-Simulator
This simulator is currently in production, though the overall goal is to create a simulator that accurately depicts satellite orbits around earth, with more goals to come.
Current Goals:

- Create a central sphere object [X]
- Create smaller objects orbiting central sphere [X]
- Use accurate distances/volumes/speeds [X]
- Allow rotation around X and Y axes. [X]
- Predict collisions based on starting variabes (maybe)
- setup cone regions on earth dependent on longitude and latitude.
- change satellite spheres to cone arrows [X]
- apply earth texture [X]
